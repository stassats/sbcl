# While most of SBCL is derived from the CMU CL system, the test

# Before sbcl-1.0.13 or so, we set up some environment variables to
# the absolute (POSIX) pathname naming the SBCL runtime, core, and
# home; but this runs afoul of the Bourne shell's repeated
# tokenization of its inputs, so now we use some shell functions.

# (Of course, zero is the usual success value, but we don't want to
# use that because SBCL returns that by default, so we might think
# we passed a test when in fact some error caused us to exit SBCL
# in a weird unexpected way. In contrast, 104 is unlikely to be
# returned unless we exit through the intended explicit "test
# successful" path.

# this (e.g., ones that end in S-L-A-D), or need to indicate some
# other ways of succeeding.  So this routine takes a test name, the
# exit status of the child, and then an arbitrary number extra
# arguments that will be treated as status-code/message pairs for
# unusual successful ways for the inferior SBCL to exit.  If the exit
# code of the SBCL isn't found in the status-codes, the calling script
