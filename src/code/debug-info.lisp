;;;; flags for compiled debug variables

;;;    Compiled debug variables are in a packed binary representation in the
;;; DEBUG-FUN-VARS:
;;;    single byte of boolean flags:
;;;     uninterned name
;;;     packaged name
;;;     environment-live
;;;     has distinct save location
;;;     has ID (name not unique in this fun)
;;;     minimal debug-info argument (name generated as ARG-0, ...)
;;;     deleted: placeholder for unused minimal argument
;;;    [name length in bytes (as var-length integer), if not minimal]
;;;    [...name bytes..., if not minimal]
;;;    [if packaged, var-length integer that is package name length]
;;;     ...package name bytes...]
;;;    [If has ID, ID as var-length integer]
;;;    SC-Offset of primary location (as var-length integer)
;;;    [If has save SC, SC-OFFSET of save location (as var-length integer)]

  ;; primitive objects (used in CMU CL to look up names elsewhere,
  ;; e.g. in CL:FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION and in CL:DESCRIBE).
  ;;
  ;; They're coupled by the way that DEBUG-FUN objects are looked up.

;;;; packed debug function

;;; The packed debug info format compactly represents debug-info for
;;; all debug levels.
;;;
;;; In the packed format, the debug functions and function map are
;;; packed into a single byte-vector which is placed in the
;;; COMPILED-DEBUG-INFO-FUN-MAP. The vector is a sequence
;;; of records in this format:
;;;    name representation + kind + return convention (single byte)
;;;    bit flags (single byte)
;;;     setf, nfp, variables
;;;    [package name length (as var-length int), if name is packaged]
;;;    [...package name bytes, if name is packaged]
;;;    [name length (as var-length int), if there is a name]
;;;    [...name bytes, if there is a name]
;;;    [variables length (as var-length int), if variables flag]
;;;    [...bytes holding variable descriptions]
;;;     If variables are dumped (level 1), then the variables are all
;;;     arguments (in order) with the minimal-arg bit set.
;;;    [If returns is specified, then the number of return values]
;;;    [...sequence of var-length ints holding SC+OFFSETs of the return
;;;     value locations, if fixed return values are specified.]
;;;    return-pc location SC+OFFSET (as var-length int)
;;;    old-fp location SC+OFFSET (as var-length int)
;;;    [nfp location SC+OFFSET (as var-length int), if nfp flag]
;;;    code-start-pc (as a var-length int)
;;;     This field implicitly encodes start of this function's code in the
;;;     function map, as a delta from the previous function's code start.
;;;     If the first function in the component, then this is the delta from
;;;     0 (i.e. the absolute offset.)
;;;    start-pc (as a var-length int)
;;;     This encodes the environment start PC as an offset from the
;;;     code-start PC.
;;;    elsewhere-pc
;;;     This encodes the elsewhere code start for this function, as a delta
;;;     from the previous function's elsewhere code start. (i.e. the
;;;     encoding is the same as for code-start-pc.)

;;; ### For functions with XEPs, name could be represented more simply
;;; and compactly as some sort of info about with how to find the
;;; function entry that this is a function for. Actually, you really
;;; hardly need any info. You can just chain through the functions in
;;; the component until you find the right one. Well, I guess you need
;;; to at least know which function is an XEP for the real function
;;; (which would be useful info anyway).
